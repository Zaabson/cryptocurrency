  - Add locktime field to transaction.
  - Avoid heavy network-transport dependency (it is used for a single encodeEnum32 function).
  - Swaping the whole of networking with network-transport seems like a good idea. (but a late one)
  - Improve validate functions not to calculate searchPool multiple times. Refactor so that coinbase UTXO is not forgotten about.
  - Write more extensive block validation tests. Better after the ^ above refactor.
