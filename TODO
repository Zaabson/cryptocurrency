  - Add locktime field to transaction.
  - Swaping the whole of networking with network-transport seems like a good idea. (but a late one)
  - Improve validate functions not to calculate searchPool multiple times. Refactor so that coinbase UTXO is not forgotten about in those functions.
  - Write more extensive block validation tests. Better after the ^ above refactor.
  - Now there's blockchain file to read a starting blockchain from and file to output blockchain after closing the node.
    The blockchain is kept in memory during running time. App should better append new blocks in real time and also
    app should store minimal subset of the whole blockchain in ram. Better not to mess up this in a rush, so this will need to wait.
